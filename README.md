# -ANRInAndroid
In Android, an **ANR (Application Not Responding)** error occurs when the main thread (UI thread) of an application is blocked for too long (usually more than **5 seconds**). ANR events can happen due to various reasons, often related to poor app design or long-running operations on the main thread.

Here are the main types of ANR that can occur in Android:

### 1. **KeyDispatch Timeout (5 seconds)**
   This happens when the **UI thread is blocked** and the system cannot process user input events (e.g., touch or key events) within 5 seconds. 
   
   **Common Causes:**
   - Performing long-running operations (e.g., network requests, file I/O, database operations) directly on the **UI thread**.
   - Synchronization issues (e.g., waiting for a lock or a thread to finish on the UI thread).
   - Heavy operations like loading large images or processing large datasets in the main thread.
   
   **How to Prevent:**
   - Move time-consuming tasks (e.g., network, database, or file operations) to background threads using mechanisms like **AsyncTask**, **Thread**, **Executor**, or **Coroutines**.
   - Use the **Handler** or **post()** method to schedule UI updates after background tasks are done.

### 2. **BroadcastReceiver Timeout (10 seconds)**
   If a **BroadcastReceiver** does not finish executing its `onReceive()` method within **10 seconds**, it triggers an ANR.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Performing long tasks such as database operations or network requests inside the `onReceive()` method.
   - Trying to update the UI directly from the `onReceive()` method.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Keep the logic inside `onReceive()` as minimal as possible. Offload long-running operations to a background service (e.g., **IntentService**, **JobIntentService**).
   - Use a **WorkManager** or **JobScheduler** to schedule background work.

### 3. **Service Timeout**
   ANR can occur when a **Service** (foreground or background) takes too long to execute. The timeout thresholds for services are:
   - **Foreground Service Timeout**: **20 seconds**
   - **Background Service Timeout**: **200 seconds (3 minutes and 20 seconds)**

   **Common Causes:**
   - Running long tasks on the **main thread** inside a Service, blocking the system from processing other requests.
   - Performing synchronous network operations or file I/O on the main thread inside the Service.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Move heavy operations to a background thread using mechanisms like **IntentService**, **AsyncTask**, **Threads**, or **Coroutines**.
   - Use **JobScheduler** or **WorkManager** for background work.

### 4. **ContentProvider Timeout (10 seconds)**
   When a **ContentProvider** takes too long (more than 10 seconds) to handle a request from another process, it triggers an ANR.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Performing long database queries, network requests, or file I/O operations in the `ContentProvider`'s `query()`, `insert()`, `delete()`, or `update()` methods.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Use asynchronous processing (e.g., **CursorLoader**, **AsyncTaskLoader**) to handle data loading from the `ContentProvider`.
   - Offload long-running database operations to a background thread.

### 5. **InputDispatching Timeout (5 seconds)**
   This happens when the system is unable to dispatch input events (e.g., touch events, key presses) to the app because the **main thread is blocked**.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Long computations or blocking I/O operations (like reading files, networking, or database access) on the main thread.
   - Synchronous operations that do not return control to the main thread in a timely manner.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Avoid performing long-running tasks on the UI thread.
   - Use **Coroutines** or **RxJava** to move long-running tasks to background threads.
   - Ensure all input events are processed quickly (ideally in under 16 milliseconds).

### 6. **Window Leaked Timeout**
   This occurs when an app tries to update or modify UI elements (like showing or dismissing dialogs) after the `Activity` has been destroyed.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Trying to display a **Dialog** or update the UI after an `Activity` has been finished.
   - Long-running operations holding references to destroyed activities or fragments, leading to memory leaks.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Ensure that dialogs or UI operations are dismissed before the activity or fragment is destroyed.
   - Use **WeakReferences** or **LifecycleObservers** to safely handle UI operations tied to the lifecycle of the activity or fragment.

### 7. **Database Operation Timeout**
   ANR can occur when a database operation (e.g., `SQLiteDatabase`, `Room`) runs for too long on the **main thread**. Android discourages performing heavy database queries on the main thread.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Large, complex database queries (e.g., querying thousands of rows) on the UI thread.
   - Writing large amounts of data synchronously on the main thread.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Always perform database operations in the background using **Room's LiveData**, **Coroutines**, or **AsyncTask**.
   - Use **Room's Paging Library** for efficient data loading and display in a paginated way.

### 8. **Deadlock**
   If two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource (e.g., a synchronized block or lock), a **deadlock** can occur, blocking the main thread and causing an ANR.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Incorrect use of **synchronized** blocks, causing threads to wait indefinitely.
   - Using blocking locks like `Thread.join()` or `Object.wait()` inappropriately.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Avoid deadlocks by careful synchronization management.
   - Use **ReentrantLock** or **tryLock()** for non-blocking lock management.
   - Use **Coroutines** for efficient, non-blocking concurrent tasks.

### 9. **Rendering Too Many Views**
   If the app has a very complex layout with a large number of nested views, it may take too long to render, causing the main thread to block and resulting in an ANR.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Deeply nested layouts (e.g., multiple `LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout` combinations).
   - Inflating too many views at once, especially in `RecyclerView` or `ListView`.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Use efficient layout structures (e.g., **ConstraintLayout** or **RecyclerView**).
   - Use **ViewStubs** for lazily loading complex views.
   - Optimize your UI rendering with **Layout Inspector** and **Profile GPU Rendering** tools.

### 10. **Network Operation on Main Thread**
   Performing synchronous network operations (HTTP requests, WebSocket connections, etc.) on the main thread can block it and cause an ANR.

   **Common Causes:**
   - Directly performing network requests (e.g., using `HttpUrlConnection`, `Retrofit` without `async` methods) on the main thread.
   - Using synchronous networking libraries without moving operations to background threads.

   **How to Prevent:**
   - Move network operations to a background thread using **Coroutines**, **AsyncTask**, or **WorkManager**.
   - Always use asynchronous methods for networking (e.g., Retrofitâ€™s `enqueue()` method).

### **General Tips to Avoid ANRs:**
- **Avoid Long Operations on Main Thread**: Always move time-consuming tasks off the main thread (use background threads).
- **Use Background Threading Libraries**: Use **Coroutines**, **RxJava**, **AsyncTask**, **HandlerThread**, or **Executors** for non-blocking tasks.
- **Optimize UI Rendering**: Simplify layouts and avoid excessive nested views.
- **Profile the App**: Use **Android Profiler**, **StrictMode**, and **Systrace** to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Handle UI Responsiveness**: Break down long tasks into smaller parts and update the UI progressively.
